todo:
* change around object structure? Maybe hand/deck isn't great?
  * hand "discard" should return list of top hands and point value
  * maybe a "scored set" which is cards and a score
* scoring doesn't include nobs right now
* web interface
  * show dealt hand
  * then show top N discards and expected points
  * let user choose cards to discard and what the expected value of their hand is
  * nicer display of cards - maybe sorting?
